# PyTorch_MNIST_Mini_Project

This is a mini project made using PyTorch to detect the fashion clothing designs with as much accuracy and minimum loss as possible.

This project was a part of the Data Science with Gen AI course available on PW Skills.

I thank mentor Jobandep Singh to teach us the basics of PyTorch with this mini project and help us learn more about Deep Learning (Neural Networks, Perceptron, Activation Functions, Optimizers, etc.).
